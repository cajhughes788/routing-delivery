# Delivery Routing Optimizer

A Python-based delivery routing simulator that models last-mile logistics using a nearest-neighbor algorithm and custom data structures. Built to calculate optimal package routes, simulate truck departures, and display delivery status at any time.

## Key Features

- **Optimized Route Planning**: Implements nearest-neighbor algorithm to reduce total mileage.
- **Custom Hash Table**: Fast package lookup for status updates and delivery tracking.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Supports querying package delivery status by timestamp.
- **Multi-Truck Scheduling**: Staggered truck departures with independent routing.
